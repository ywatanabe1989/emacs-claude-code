- [ ] Dedicated mode for list states
- [ ] Improve how repository content is selected and copied
  - [ ] Integrate a script in `./from_user/` as a ecc- module
- [ ] Feedback system
  - [ ] View repo and send to Claude
    - [ ] use the `./from_user/view_repo.sh`
3. Create dynamic template loading based on detected project type

#### Tasks:
2. Add cache loading for templates using hash
3. Improve caching mechanisms for response history using hash
4. Add configurable buffer size limits
5. Implement session pruning for memory management?

### Goal 3: Enhance User Experience
