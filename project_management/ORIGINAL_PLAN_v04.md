# Emacs Claude Code - Project Plan

## 1. Project Description

Emacs Claude Code is an Emacs integration for the Claude AI assistant, providing an efficient and powerful interface for interacting with Claude directly within Emacs. The project aims to leverage Emacs' extensibility and text manipulation capabilities to create a seamless development environment where Claude can assist with coding, documentation, and other text-based tasks.

The integration includes buffer management for multiple Claude sessions, state tracking, template-based prompts, and specialized modes for different interaction patterns. This creates a robust environment for both human-in-the-loop AI assistance and experimental AI-AI interaction scenarios.

The project also includes Apptainer/Singularity containerization support, enabling consistent deployment across different environments and simplifying setup for new users.

## 2. Goals

1. **Enhance Developer Productivity** - Create an intuitive interface for interacting with Claude within the Emacs environment, eliminating context switching and streamlining workflows.

2. **Support Multiple Claude Sessions** - Enable developers to manage and interact with multiple Claude instances simultaneously, with clear visibility into each session's state.

3. **Optimize for AI-Assisted Development** - Design specialized interfaces and workflows that leverage Claude's capabilities for coding, documentation, and problem-solving.

4. **Enable Experimental AI Interaction Patterns** - Support novel interaction models including AI-AI collaboration, human-in-the-loop workflows, and automated guidance.

5. **Maintain Emacs Philosophy** - Adhere to Emacs' extensibility principles, creating a solution that is hackable, keyboard-driven, and text-focused.

6. **Provide Containerized Deployment** - Support consistent deployment across environments through containerization, simplifying setup and ensuring reproducibility.

2. Disable line numbers and other features that might slow down output
3. Implement specialized keybindings for Claude interactions
4. Add visual indicators for Claude's state
5. Test performance with large outputs

#### Test Improvement

2. Add tests for recently added features
3. Implement mocks for Claude interaction
4. Update test documentation

### For Milestone 3

#### CLAUD-CODE-LIST-MODE Implementation
1. Design buffer layout for session dashboard

4. Improve Claude state detection for edge cases

## 5. Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Buffer Management**: Handles creation, tracking, and lifecycle of Claude buffers
- **State Detection**: Identifies Claude's prompt state (waiting, Y/N, etc.)
- **Template System**: Manages and applies prompt templates
- **History Management**: Tracks and allows retrieval of past interactions
- **Container System**: Provides consistent deployment environment via Apptainer

### Planned Components
- **Session Dashboard**: Provides overview and management of all Claude sessions
- **Vector Store**: Local embeddings database for context and memory
- **External Integration**: Connectors to Slack, files, and other channels
- **AI-AI Framework**: Structure for Claude instances to communicate with each other

## 6. Timeline and Priorities

### Short Term (1-2 months)
- Complete remaining Milestone 2 tasks (CLAUDE-CODE-VTERM-MODE and test improvements)
- Begin initial work on CLAUD-CODE-LIST-MODE dashboard

### Medium Term (3-6 months)
- Complete Milestone 3 (Multi-Session Management)
- Start development on AI-AI interaction framework
- Implement human-in-the-loop environment

### Long Term (6-12 months)
- Complete Milestone 4 (Advanced Interaction Patterns)
- Implement Milestone 5 (Knowledge Integration)
- Explore integration with other AI systems beyond Claude

## 7. Development Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Modularity**: Keep components focused and loosely coupled
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve user workflows and configurations
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear, updated documentation
5. **User Experience**: Prioritize intuitive, keyboard-driven interfaces
6. **Containerization**: Ensure consistent and reproducible environments

## 8. Success Metrics

1. Test coverage >95%
2. Buffer switching and state detection latency <100ms
3. Support for at least 10 simultaneous Claude sessions
4. Successful implementation of all major modes (VTERM, LIST)
5. User adoption and feedback
6. Successful container deployment across different environments

## 9. Deployment Strategies

### Local Installation
- Standard Emacs package installation
- Configuration through customize interface or init.el

### Containerized Deployment
- Apptainer/Singularity container with pre-configured environment
- Multiple user support with shared resources
- Host/container data synchronization
- Development environment consistency
