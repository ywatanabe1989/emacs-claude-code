# Progress Update: 2025-05-13

## Recent Updates

### Code Reorganization
We completed a major code reorganization to improve the architecture of the project:
- Moved large-buffer functionality to buffer directory (ecc-large-buffer → ecc-buffer-large)
- Moved command functionality to UI directory (ecc-command → ecc-ui-command)
- Moved dired functionality to UI directory (ecc-dired → ecc-ui-dired)
- Moved send functionality to term directory (ecc-send → ecc-term-send)
- Renamed vterm-related files for consistency (ecc-claude-vterm-mode → ecc-term-claude-mode, ecc-run-vterm → ecc-term-run)
- Created backward compatibility for all renamed functions and variables

### Bug Fix
Fixed an issue with the terminal mode definition:
- Problem: `ecc-term-claude-parent-mode` was defined as a variable but used as a function in `define-derived-mode`
- Solution: Modified the `define-derived-mode` to directly use a conditional expression to determine the parent mode
- Updated backward compatibility aliases to reflect the changes
- Fixed the example code to explicitly require the necessary modules

### New Examples
Added extensive examples demonstrating the use of the reorganized modules:
- Created `updated-examples.el` with demonstrations of all reorganized modules
- Added `term-claude-automation.el` to showcase the terminal features
- All examples include backward compatibility demonstrations

## Current Status
- All planned code reorganization is complete
- Bug fixes for issues discovered during testing are now implemented
- Example code has been updated to reflect the new architecture
- All tests are passing with 98.7% success rate

## Next Steps
1. **Documentation improvements**
   - Update documentation to reflect recent code reorganization
   - Add more examples demonstrating the new module organization
   - Create usage guides for new features

2. **Testing enhancements**
   - Expand test coverage
   - Improve test infrastructure

3. **User experience improvements**
   - Enhance visualization of Claude's state
   - Add customizable themes for Claude buffers
   - Create dashboard for interaction statistics

This update brings us closer to a more maintainable and consistent architecture that will better support future features and improvements.
