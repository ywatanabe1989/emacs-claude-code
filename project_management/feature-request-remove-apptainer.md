# Feature Request: Remove Apptainer-Related Content

## Request Description
Remove all Apptainer-related content from the project to simplify the codebase and reduce dependencies. This will focus the project solely on the core Emacs Claude integration functionality.

## Rationale
- Simplify the codebase and reduce maintenance burden
- Focus development efforts on core Claude integration features
- Remove containerization complexity that may not be essential for all users
- Make the project more approachable for new contributors

## Scope
- Remove all Apptainer-related code, documentation, and configuration files
- Update project plans and documentation to reflect this change
- Ensure that the core functionality remains intact without dependencies on Apptainer
- Update tests to remove Apptainer-related tests

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All Apptainer-related files are removed from the codebase
2. Project documentation is updated to remove Apptainer references
3. Project management documents are updated to reflect the new direction
4. All tests pass after the removal of Apptainer components
5. Core functionality remains fully functional

## Files to Remove/Modify
- `/docs/apptainer.md`
- `/docs/simple-apptainer.md`
- `/project_management/simple-apptainer-plan.md`
- `/project_management/full-apptainer-plan.md`
- Any Apptainer-related scripts in the codebase
- References to Apptainer in project documentation (README.md, etc.)
- Update project plans to remove Apptainer-related goals and milestones

## Impact Assessment
- Positive: Simplified codebase, reduced maintenance burden
- Positive: More focused development on core Emacs Claude integration
- Negative: Loss of containerized deployment option (can be addressed with alternative deployment instructions if needed)

## Proposed By
Claude (on behalf of ywatanabe)

## Status
Pending implementation
