# Bug Report: Symbol's function definition is void: ecc-term-claude-parent-mode

## Description
When trying to use the example function `example-start-claude-term-session` from the reorganized code modules, users encounter an error:

```elisp
let: Symbol's function definition is void: ecc-term-claude-parent-mode
```

The error occurs in the newly created example file that demonstrates the terminal automation capabilities after the code reorganization.

## Error Context
```elisp
(defun example-start-claude-term-session ()
  "Start a Claude session in a vterm buffer with term-claude-mode."
  (interactive)
  
  ;; Ensure vterm is available
  (unless (featurep 'vterm)
    (error "This example requires vterm to be installed"))
  
  ;; Start Claude using the new terminal module (renamed from ecc-run-vterm)
  (require 'ecc-term-run)
  
  ;; Create a new Claude terminal session with auto-mode enabled
  (let ((buffer (ecc-term-run-claude)))
    (with-current-buffer buffer
      ;; Enable auto-responses to Claude prompts
      (ecc-term-claude-auto-mode-toggle)
      
      ;; Customize terminal appearance
      (setq-local ecc-term-claude-truncate-lines nil) ; disable line truncation
      
      ;; Set up a status message
      (message "Claude terminal session started with auto-mode enabled"))))
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because `ecc-term-claude-parent-mode` was defined as a variable in the `ecc-term-claude-mode.el` file, but was being treated as a function when used as the parent mode in `define-derived-mode`. In `ecc-term-claude-mode.el`:

```elisp
;; Define a parent mode to fallback to if vterm isn't available
(defvar ecc-term-claude-parent-mode
  (if ecc-term-claude--vterm-available
      'vterm-mode
    'special-mode)
  "Parent mode for ecc-term-claude-mode.")

;; [Later in the file]
(define-derived-mode ecc-term-claude-mode ecc-term-claude-parent-mode "Claude-VTerm"
  "Major mode for optimized Claude interaction in vterm.")
```

`define-derived-mode` expects a symbol naming a function (the parent mode), but we were passing a variable that evaluates to a symbol, which is incorrect usage.

## Applied Fix
1. Renamed the variable to clarify its purpose:
   ```elisp
   (defvar ecc-term-claude-parent-mode-symbol
     (if ecc-term-claude--vterm-available
         'vterm-mode
       'special-mode)
     "Symbol of parent mode for ecc-term-claude-mode.")
   ```

2. Modified the `define-derived-mode` to use a direct conditional expression:
   ```elisp
   (define-derived-mode ecc-term-claude-mode 
     ;; Use the symbol directly, not the variable
     (if ecc-term-claude--vterm-available 'vterm-mode 'special-mode)
     "Claude-VTerm"
     "Major mode for optimized Claude interaction in vterm.")
   ```

3. Updated all backward compatibility aliases:
   ```elisp
   (defalias 'ecc-claude-vterm-parent-mode-symbol 'ecc-term-claude-parent-mode-symbol)
   ```

4. Updated the example to explicitly require the mode module:
   ```elisp
   (require 'ecc-term-run)
   (require 'ecc-term-claude-mode)
   ```

## Testing
- Verified that `ecc-term-claude-mode` loads correctly
- Tested the example function to ensure it works properly
- Ensured backward compatibility with old names is maintained
