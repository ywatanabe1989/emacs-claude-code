# Bug Report: Symbol's function definition is void: ecc-term-claude-parent-mode

## Description
When trying to use the example function `example-start-claude-term-session` from the reorganized code modules, users encounter an error:

```elisp
let: Symbol's function definition is void: ecc-term-claude-parent-mode
```

The error occurs in the newly created example file that demonstrates the terminal automation capabilities after the code reorganization.

## Error Context
```elisp
(defun example-start-claude-term-session ()
  "Start a Claude session in a vterm buffer with term-claude-mode."
  (interactive)
  
  ;; Ensure vterm is available
  (unless (featurep 'vterm)
    (error "This example requires vterm to be installed"))
  
  ;; Start Claude using the new terminal module (renamed from ecc-run-vterm)
  (require 'ecc-term-run)
  
  ;; Create a new Claude terminal session with auto-mode enabled
  (let ((buffer (ecc-term-run-claude)))
    (with-current-buffer buffer
      ;; Enable auto-responses to Claude prompts
      (ecc-term-claude-auto-mode-toggle)
      
      ;; Customize terminal appearance
      (setq-local ecc-term-claude-truncate-lines nil) ; disable line truncation
      
      ;; Set up a status message
      (message "Claude terminal session started with auto-mode enabled"))))
```

## Root Cause
The error is occurring because `ecc-term-claude-parent-mode` is defined as a variable in the `ecc-term-claude-mode.el` file, but it's being treated as a function when used as the parent mode in `define-derived-mode`. The specific issue is in the `ecc-term-claude-mode.el` file:

```elisp
;; Define a parent mode to fallback to if vterm isn't available
(defvar ecc-term-claude-parent-mode
  (if ecc-term-claude--vterm-available
      'vterm-mode
    'special-mode)
  "Parent mode for ecc-term-claude-mode.")

;; [Later in the file]
(define-derived-mode ecc-term-claude-mode ecc-term-claude-parent-mode "Claude-VTerm"
  "Major mode for optimized Claude interaction in vterm.")
```

The problem is that `define-derived-mode` expects a symbol naming a function (the parent mode), but we're passing a variable that evaluates to a symbol. This is incorrect usage of `define-derived-mode`.

## Priority and Severity
**Priority: High**
This is a critical issue that prevents the newly reorganized terminal mode functionality from working at all. Since terminal integration is a core feature and was part of the reorganization effort, this should be fixed immediately.

**Reasoning:**
1. The bug completely prevents using the terminal features after reorganization
2. It's a simple fix that won't require extensive changes
3. The example code won't work until this is fixed
4. This affects core functionality of the package

## Fix Plan

1. **Create a feature branch for the fix**
   - Branch name: `feature/bug-fix-ecc-term-claude-parent-mode`

2. **Fix the parent mode definition in `ecc-term-claude-mode.el`**
   - Instead of using a variable to determine the parent mode, we should use a direct conditional in the `define-derived-mode` call or define separate modes depending on vterm availability

3. **Update the example file if needed**
   - Ensure the example works with the fixed mode definition

4. **Test the fix**
   - Verify that `ecc-term-claude-mode` loads correctly
   - Test the example function to ensure it works properly

5. **Update progress documentation**
   - Add the bug fix to the progress tracking

6. **Commit the changes**
   - Use an appropriate commit message explaining the fix

7. **Merge back to the develop branch**
   - Follow the regular workflow for merging feature branches

8. **Move the bug report to the fixed folder**
   - Move the bug report file to the `./project_management/bug-report-fixed/` directory
