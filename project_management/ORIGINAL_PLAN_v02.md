## !!! IMPORTANT !!! DO NOT EDIT OTHER THAN THE USER.

## CLAUD-CODE-LIST-MODE
  This is a brilliant addition - having a dashboard to see all buffers with their states
  would vastly improve multi-session management. It would make switching between sessions more intuitive and
  provide at-a-glance status information.

## CLAUDE-CODE-VTERM-MODE
  A dedicated vterm-based approach could simplify things significantly. Optimizing for high-speed
  streaming without line numbers would improve performance.

    - Optimized settings for high speed streaming
    - Visualization
