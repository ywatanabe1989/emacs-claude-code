;;; Commentary:
;; Large buffer handling examples for emacs-claude-code.
;; This example demonstrates how to:
;; 1. Process and send large text files to Claude
;; 2. Customize chunking behavior for large inputs
;; 3. Handle large code bases and documentation
;; 4. Implement progressive loading with feedback
